// NOTES:
//   Reference variables are actually pointers.
//
//   There is a part of your memory that you cannot touch. This is called the
//   heap. We've been using the stack up until this point. The heap is many
//   times larger than the stack.
//   Pointers allow you to access this part of the memory. If you want to make
//   your program faster and use more memory you must use pointers  to access
//   the heap. This is important for data-structures in C
